# This is CS229 Notes for Learning ML
How to choose the Machine learning Coures, for me I recommand the Andrew Ng' Course.

The CS229 is a good class to start the machine learning.

When I learn a lectrue i will sort the all the algorithms in the lecture.

And there may be many algorithms in one lecture.

I will work on it in the future.
